# SearchMind
### AI-minded search so you can spend less time looking, and more time doing

SearchMind is a macOS utility that will help you find that elusive file you’ve been searching for—whether it’s a selfie from a few years back or an important document with many versions floating around. Our goal is to streamline file discovery so you can spend less time combing through directories and more time getting things done.

## Status: Early Idea Phase
> We’re just getting started with brainstorming and project planning. There’s no working code here yet, but we have big plans!

## Project Vision
We want **SearchMind** to leverage AI and advanced indexing to provide lightning-fast, accurate results to your file search queries. Instead of remembering cryptic folder structures or slogging through a Finder window, you’ll be able to run a simple command and let SearchMind do the heavy lifting.

### Key Goals
- Intelligent indexing and search results  
- Fast, command-line-based interactions using SwiftArgumentParser  
- Minimal resource usage  
- A user-friendly macOS integration, eventually with a GUI

## Planned Features
1. **Command Line Interface**  
   - Built with [Swift Argument Parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) to handle commands and flags in a clean, intuitive way.  
   - Example usage might look like:
     ```bash
     $ searchmind find "family vacation 2019" --extension jpg
     ```
2. **AI-Powered Search**  
   - Potential use of natural language processing to understand search queries and context.  
   - Ability to learn from your past searches to deliver more relevant results.  
3. **File Preview and Quick Actions**  
   - Provide quick previews or metadata about found files.  
   - Potential integration with macOS Quick Look or a future GUI.  
4. **Configurable Indexing**  
   - Let users define folders or drives to index, ignoring certain file types or large system directories.  
5. **Modular Architecture**  
   - The core search engine will be independent, so you can integrate it with a GUI or other services in the future.

## Technology
- **Swift**: Chosen for its performance and first-class macOS integration.  
- **Swift Argument Parser**: To easily define and parse command-line arguments in a Swifty manner.  
- **(Planned) AI/ML Tools**: We’re exploring frameworks and libraries that can power advanced search logic.

## Usage (Concept)
Since this project is still in the idea stage, here’s an example of what CLI usage *might* look like in the future:

```bash
$ searchmind help
Available commands:
  find      Search for files by name, keywords, or AI-inferred context
  index     Manually re-index specific directories
  config    Update or view indexing configurations
  version   Display the current version of SearchMind

$ searchmind find "tax documents 2020"
Found 2 results:
 1. /Users/username/Documents/Taxes/2020/Taxes-2020-Final.pdf
 2. /Users/username/Documents/Taxes/2020/Receipt-2020.jpg
```

Stay tuned for further updates once we have a functional prototype!

   - Outline architectural needs.
   - Research fast and efficient argument parsing
   - Research AI/ML solutions for file search.
2. **Proof of Concept** (Coming Soon)  
   - Implement a simple command-line interface with Swift Argument Parser.  
   - Basic file indexing and search functionality.  
3. **Alpha Release**  
   - Preliminary AI-driven search.  
   - Collaboration with contributors to refine indexing, search logic, and user experience.  
4. **Beta Release**  
   - Feature enhancements, bug fixes, and performance optimization.  
5. **Stable v1.0**  
   - Polished CLI/GUI (if applicable).  
   - Comprehensive documentation and improved AI features.

## Contributing
We’d love your help shaping the direction of **SearchMind**. Because we’re still in the idea phase, **opening an issue** to discuss suggestions and feedback is the best way to contribute. Once the codebase is more mature, you’ll be able to:

- Open feature requests and bug reports  
- Submit pull requests  
- Suggest improvements or documentation updates  

**Join us early** and help create a robust AI-powered search tool for macOS users!
